      JumboTrace is a tool that can track and record what happens when a Java
      program runs, including the values of variables and which lines of code
      get executed. It modifies the program's code to add logging, and the logs
      get stored in a file for later viewing. This can help understand how a
      program works and find bugs.
    tech_desc: >
      JumboTrace is an experimental tracer for Java programs that records the
      evolution of program state during execution to build a trace (sequence of
      events and executed lines). It works by injecting logging calls into the
      program using a compiler plugin for javac. The logged events are written
      to a binary file using serialization, and a minimal frontend can display
      the traces in the console.

      This project provides a software implementation of a regular expression
      engine for matching text patterns in JavaScript. It has efficient linear
      time and space complexity for advanced features like lookarounds and
      capture groups. The engine is written in OCaml and aims to improve
      privacy-preserving and digital trust by offering a reliable and efficient
      regex matching solution.
    tech_desc: >
      This is a linear regular expression engine for a subset of JavaScript
      regexes, implemented in OCaml. It supports features like nullable
      quantifiers, capture reset, and lookarounds with linear time and space
      complexity. The engine is based on an extension of the PikeVM algorithm,
      described in the paper "Linear Matching of JavaScript Regular
      Expressions".
