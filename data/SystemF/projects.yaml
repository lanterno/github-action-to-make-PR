      JumboTrace is a tool that can track and record what happens when a
      Java program runs, including the values of variables and which
      lines of code get executed. It modifies the program's code to add
      logging, and the logs get stored in a file for later viewing.
      This can help understand how a program works and find bugs.
    tech_desc: >
      JumboTrace is an experimental tracer for Java programs that records
      the evolution of program state during execution to build a trace
      (sequence of events and executed lines). It works by injecting
      logging calls into the program using a compiler plugin for javac.
      The logged events are written to a binary file using serialization,
      and a minimal frontend can display the traces in the console.

      Linear regex engine for JavaScript in OCaml

      This project provides a software implementation of a regular
      expression engine for matching text patterns in JavaScript. It
      has efficient linear time and space complexity for advanced
      features like lookarounds and capture groups. The engine is
      written in OCaml and aims to improve privacy-preserving and
      digital trust by offering a reliable and efficient regex
      matching solution.
    tech_desc: >
      This is a linear regular expression engine for a subset of
      JavaScript regexes, implemented in OCaml. It supports features
      like nullable quantifiers, capture reset, and lookarounds with
      linear time and space complexity. The engine is based on an
      extension of the PikeVM algorithm, described in the paper
      "Linear Matching of JavaScript Regular Expressions".
