      ADEFAN (Adaptive Depth Efficient Filtering by Adaptive Normaliztion) is a
      state-of-the-art technology for encoding and decoding videos that presents
      many advantages over other available methods. It features extremely
      energy-efficient encoder, extremely fast encoding process, no specialized
      hardware for encoding and added security with encoding key. It is this
      ideal for video-transmitting IoT devices, continuously transmitting
      surveillance cameras, emergency deployment in areas without much
      infrastructure (remote, natural disaster relief, etc.).

    description: Noise-robust image classification
    tech_desc: >
      Image classification has significantly improved using deep learning. This
      is mainly due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are capable of
      learning rich feature extractors from large datasets. However, most deep
      learning classification methods are trained on clean images and are not
      robust when handling noisy ones, even if a restoration preprocessing step
      is applied.  We propose a method that can be applied on a pretrained
      classifier.  We improve the noisy-image classification (NIC) results by
      significantly large margins, especially at high noise levels, and come
      close to the fully retrained approaches.

    description: Deep learning image denoiser
    tech_desc: >
      Blind and universal image denoising consists of using a unique model that
      denoises images with any level of noise. It is especially practical as
      noise levels do not need to be known when the model is developed or at
      test time. We propose a blind and universal deep learning image denoiser
      based on an optimal denoising solution, which we call fusion denoising.
      Our approach improves real-world grayscale additive image denoising. It
      also improves state-of-the-art color image denoising performance on every
      single noise level by an average of 0.1dB.

      Medical image fusion plays a central role by integrating information from
      multiple sources into a single, more understandable output. We propose a
      real-time image fusion method using pre-trained neural networks to
      generate a single image containing features from multi-modal sources. Our
      method can be applied to any number of input sources.

      When generating an image using a GAN, some errors might appear which are
      obvious to the human observer, but not to the computer. By introducing
      this user feedback one can refine the generated image to look even more

      Despite achieving remarkable progress in recent years, single-image
      super-resolution methods are developed with artificial limitations. We
      propose a novel drone image dataset, with scenes captured at low and high
      resolutions, and across a span of altitudes. Our results show that
      off-the-shelf state-of-the-art networks perform worse on this different
      domain.

    description: Uncovering Temporal Information for Deep Saliency Prediction
    tech_desc: >
      Deep saliency prediction algorithms complement the object recognition
      features, they typically rely on additional information, such as scene
      context, semantic relationships, gaze direction, and object dissimilarity.
      However, none of these models consider the temporal nature of gaze shifts
      during image observation. We introduce a novel saliency prediction model
      that learns to output saliency maps in sequential time intervals by
      exploiting human temporal attention patterns.

    description: Real-Time Dynamic Texture Synthesis Using Neural Cellular Automata
    tech_desc: >
      Current Dynamic Texture Synthesis (DyTS) models in the literature can
      synthesize realistic videos. However, these methods require a slow
      iterative optimization process to synthesize a single fixed-size short
      video, and they do not offer any post-training control over the synthesis
      process. We propose Dynamic Neural Cellular Automata (DyNCA), a framework
      for real-time and controllable dynamic texture synthesis.
