      ADEFAN (Adaptive Depth Efficient Filtering by Adaptive Normaliztion) is a state-of-the-art technology for encoding and decoding videos
      that presents many advantages over other available methods. It features extremely energy-efficient encoder, extremely fast encoding
      process, no specialized hardware for encoding and added security with encoding key. It is this ideal for video-transmitting IoT
      devices, continuously transmitting surveillance cameras, emergency deployment in areas without much infrastructure (remote, natural
      disaster relief, etc.).

    description: Noise-robust image classification
    tech_desc: >
      Image classification has significantly improved using deep learning. This is mainly due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
      are capable of learning rich feature extractors from large datasets. However, most deep learning classification methods are trained on
      clean images and are not robust when handling noisy ones, even if a restoration preprocessing step is applied.  We propose a method
      that can be applied on a pretrained classifier.  We improve the noisy-image classification (NIC) results by significantly large
      margins, especially at high noise levels, and come close to the fully retrained approaches.

    description: Deep learning image denoiser
    tech_desc: >
      Blind and universal image denoising consists of using a unique model that denoises images with any level of noise. It is especially
      practical as noise levels do not need to be known when the model is developed or at test time. We propose a blind and universal deep
      learning image denoiser based on an optimal denoising solution, which we call fusion denoising. Our approach improves real-world
      grayscale additive image denoising. It also improves state-of-the-art color image denoising performance on every single noise level by
      an average of 0.1dB.

    description: High-quality image fusion
    tech_desc: >
      Medical image fusion plays a central role by integrating information from multiple sources into a single, more understandable output.
      We propose a real-time image fusion method using pre-trained neural networks to generate a single image containing features from
      multi-modal sources. Our method can be applied to any number of input sources.

      Despite achieving remarkable progress in recent years, single-image super-resolution methods are developed with artificial
      limitations. We propose a novel drone image dataset, with scenes captured at low and high resolutions, and across a span of altitudes.
      Our results show that off-the-shelf state-of-the-art networks perform worse on this different domain.

    description: Uncovering Temporal Information for Deep Saliency Prediction
    tech_desc: >
      Deep saliency prediction algorithms complement the object recognition features, they typically rely on additional information, such as
      scene context, semantic relationships, gaze direction, and object dissimilarity. However, none of these models consider the temporal
      nature of gaze shifts during image observation. We introduce a novel saliency prediction model that learns to output saliency maps in
      sequential time intervals by exploiting human temporal attention patterns.

    description: Real-Time Dynamic Texture Synthesis Using Neural Cellular Automata
    tech_desc: >
      Current Dynamic Texture Synthesis (DyTS) models in the literature can synthesize realistic videos. However, these methods require a
      slow iterative optimization process to synthesize a single fixed-size short video, and they do not offer any post-training control
      over the synthesis process. We propose Dynamic Neural Cellular Automata (DyNCA), a framework for real-time and controllable dynamic
      texture synthesis.
