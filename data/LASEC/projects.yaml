    description: Ethereum smart contracts with secret parameters
    tech_desc: >
      By design, smart contractsâ€™ data and computations are public to all
      participants. Offchainer helps to create smart contracts with parameters
      that need to stay secret. We propose a way to keep some of the parameters
      off-chain, while guaranteeing correctness of the computation, using a
      combination of a commitment scheme and a zero-knowledge proof system.
