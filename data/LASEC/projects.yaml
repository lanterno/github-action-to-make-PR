    description: Ethereum smart contracts with secret parameters
    tech_desc: >
      By design, smart contracts’ data and computations are public to all participants. Offchainer helps to create smart contracts with
      parameters that need to stay secret. We propose a way to keep some of the parameters off-chain, while guaranteeing correctness of the
      computation, using a combination of a commitment scheme and a zero-knowledge proof system.
