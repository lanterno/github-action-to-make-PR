    description: Privacy evaluation framework for synthetic data publishing
    layman_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library allows data holders to evaluate how much publishing a synthetic dataset in place of a
      sensitive raw dataset reduces the privacy risk for the individuals whose data is included in the raw data. The results of the
      evaluation help to inform decisions about whether to publish the data or which generative model provides the best trade-off between
      utility and privacy gain.
    tech_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library measures the privacy gain of publishing a synthetic dataset in place of the raw data with
      respect to a specific privacy concern. Each concern is modelled as a privacy adversary that targets an individual record and aims to
      infer a secret about this record. The library includes implementations of two new privacy attacks on the output of a generative model.
      To evaluate privacy gain, the framework is instantiated under the chosen threat model and outputs an estimate about how much
      publishing the synthetic data instead of the raw data reduces the privacy loss of a chosen target record under this threat model.

      Applying the privacy-preserving algorithms of Tandem to the usage of the Monero blockchain.
    tech_desc: >
      One challenge when using private keys is that if they get stolen the damage can be very big, especially when used in blockchains to
      protect funds. Sharing the private key between multiple entities can secure the usage a bit, but most algorithms don't give privacy.
      In the context of a privacy-preserving service like Monero, where the source and destination of a transaction are hidden, these
      algorithms would leak information about the user. Applying Tandem to transactions on the Monero blockchain allows to protect the
      private key in case of loss, while keeping the owner of the transaction private.

      Framework to build privacy-preserving Private Collection Matching (PCM) systems
    tech_desc: >
      We introduce Private Collection Matching (PCM) problems, in which a client aims to determine whether a collection of sets owned by a
      server matches their interests. Existing privacy-preserving cryptographic primitives cannot solve PCM problems efficiently without
      harming privacy. We propose a modular framework that enables designers to build privacy-preserving PCM systems that output one bit:
      whether a collection of server sets matches the client's set. The communication cost of our protocols scales linearly with the size of
      the client's set and is independent of the number of server elements. We demonstrate the potential of our framework by designing and
      implementing novel solutions for two real-world PCM problems: determining whether a dataset has chemical compounds of interest, and
      determining whether a document collection has relevant documents. Our evaluation shows that we offer a privacy gain with respect to
      existing works at a reasonable communication and computation cost.
