    description: Privacy evaluation framework for synthetic data publishing
    layman_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library allows data holders to evaluate
      how much publishing a synthetic dataset in place of a sensitive raw
      dataset reduces the privacy risk for the individuals whose data is
      included in the raw data. The results of the evaluation help to inform
      decisions about whether to publish the data or which generative model
      provides the best trade-off between utility and privacy gain.
    tech_desc: >
      The framework implemented in this library measures the privacy gain of
      publishing a synthetic dataset in place of the raw data with respect to a
      specific privacy concern. Each concern is modelled as a privacy adversary
      that targets an individual record and aims to infer a secret about this
      record. The library includes implementations of two new privacy attacks on
      the output of a generative model. To evaluate privacy gain, the framework
      is instantiated under the chosen threat model and outputs an estimate
      about how much publishing the synthetic data instead of the raw data
      reduces the privacy loss of a chosen target record under this threat
      model.

      Applying the privacy-preserving algorithms of Tandem to the usage of the
      Monero blockchain.
    tech_desc: >
      One challenge when using private keys is that if they get stolen the
      damage can be very big, especially when used in blockchains to protect
      funds. Sharing the private key between multiple entities can secure the
      usage a bit, but most algorithms don't give privacy. In the context of a
      privacy-preserving service like Monero, where the source and destination
      of a transaction are hidden, these algorithms would leak information about
      the user. Applying Tandem to transactions on the Monero blockchain allows
      to protect the private key in case of loss, while keeping the owner of the
      transaction private.

      Framework to build privacy-preserving Private Collection Matching (PCM)
      systems
    tech_desc: >
      We introduce Private Collection Matching (PCM) problems, in which a client
      aims to determine whether a collection of sets owned by a server matches
      their interests. Existing privacy-preserving cryptographic primitives
      cannot solve PCM problems efficiently without harming privacy. We propose
      a modular framework that enables designers to build privacy-preserving PCM
      systems that output one bit: whether a collection of server sets matches
      the client's set. The communication cost of our protocols scales linearly
      with the size of the client's set and is independent of the number of
      server elements. We demonstrate the potential of our framework by
      designing and implementing novel solutions for two real-world PCM
      problems: determining whether a dataset has chemical compounds of
      interest, and determining whether a document collection has relevant
      documents. Our evaluation shows that we offer a privacy gain with respect
      to existing works at a reasonable communication and computation cost.
