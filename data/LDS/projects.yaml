    description: A lattice-based multiparty homomorphic encryption library in Go
    tech_desc: >
      Lattigo is a Go module for Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption, that implements Ring-Learning-With-Errors-based homomorphic encryption
      primitives. It comprises highly-efficient RNS versions of the BFV and CKKS schemes and their multiparty (N-out-of-N-threshold)
      counterparts. It also implements a dense-key and sparse-key Bootstrapping procedure for RNS-CKKS.

      The Lattigo library was originally exclusively developed by the EPFL Laboratory for Data Security until its version 2.4.0. Starting
      with the release of version 3.0.0, Lattigo is maintained and supported by Tune Insight SA.

      Lattigo 2.0.0 has been code-reviewed by ELCA in November 2020 and, within the allocated time for the code review, no critical or
      high-risk issues were found.
    layman_desc: >
      Homomorphic encryption (HE) comprises a special class of cryptographic schemes that enable computing directly on encrypted data,
      without requiring the data to be decrypted first. It therefore enables a set of operations (polynomial evaluation and approximations
      of non-polynomial functions) to be "blindly" performed on encrypted sensitive data by an untrustworthy party, with a controlled
      computational overhead. Lattigo implements HE and its multiparty extension (MHE), that enables several entities to collaboratively
      compute a function on their confidential or sensitive data, without revealing to each other anything besides the result of this
      computation. Lattigo's multiparty homomorphic encryption technology is an enabler for secure data sharing in multiple scenarios.

    description: Decentralized, secure, verifiable system for statistical queries and machine learning on distributed datasets
    tech_desc: >
      Drynx allows to create privacy-preserving queries on encrypted datasets that are stored at different data providers who don't want to
      share the original data. Different types of statistical queries are possible, like average, standard deviation, linear and logistic
      regressions - all using homomorphic encryption, which means that the data is never shared in cleartext.

    description: Offload computation to services while keeping data private
    tech_desc: >
      CRISP relies on quantum-resistant lattice-based approximate homomorphic encryption primitives that support flexible polynomial
      computations on encrypted data without degrading utility. To ensure data integrity, it employs lattice-based commitments and
      zero-knowledge proofs based on the multi-party-computation-in-the-head paradigm, which enables users to simultaneously convince
      service providers about the correctness of the encrypted data as well as the authenticity of the underlying plaintext data, using the
      deployed certification mechanism.
