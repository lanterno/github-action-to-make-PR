    description: Thermal simulator for stacked integrated circuits
    layman_desc: >
      Hardware is getting smaller every day, components are being stacked on top
      of each other, in order to make theses more compact. But as it is getting
      smaller, it's also getting hotter. 3D-ICE helps in modelling how thermal
      flux are behaving.
