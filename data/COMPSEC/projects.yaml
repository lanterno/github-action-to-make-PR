      Arkworks is a collection of Rust libraries for building
      privacy-preserving applications using zero-knowledge proofs called
      zkSNARKs.  It has efficient implementations of the underlying
      cryptographic primitives like finite fields and elliptic curves.  It
      also provides tools to encode computations as circuits that can be
      proven using zkSNARKs while keeping inputs private.
    tech_desc: >
      Arkworks provides efficient implementations of components required for
      zkSNARK applications.  It includes libraries for finite fields,
      elliptic curves, R1CS constraints, and SNARK proving systems like
      Groth16 and Marlin.  It defines interfaces for relations like R1CS,
      and for building SNARK circuits using gadgets and subcircuits.
