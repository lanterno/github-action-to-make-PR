      Arkworks is a collection of Rust libraries for building privacy-preserving
      applications using zero-knowledge proofs called zkSNARKs.  It has
      efficient implementations of the underlying cryptographic primitives like
      finite fields and elliptic curves.  It also provides tools to encode
      computations as circuits that can be proven using zkSNARKs while keeping
      inputs private.
    tech_desc: >
      Arkworks provides efficient implementations of components required for
      zkSNARK applications.  It includes libraries for finite fields, elliptic
      curves, R1CS constraints, and SNARK proving systems like Groth16 and
      Marlin.  It defines interfaces for relations like R1CS, and for building
      SNARK circuits using gadgets and subcircuits.
