    description: GoLang extension to allow a programmer to execute a goroutine within an enclave
    tech_desc: >
      Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX enclaves, use hardware to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of
      operations on sensitive data. While the technology is available on many processors, the complexity of its programming model and its
      performance overhead have limited adoption. TEEs provide a new and valuable hardware functionality that has no obvious analogue in
      programming languages, which means that developers must manually partition their application into trusted and untrusted components.
      Gotee extends the Go language to allow a programmer to execute a goroutine within an enclave, to use low-overhead channels to
      communicate between the trusted and untrusted environments, and to rely on a compiler to automatically extract the secure code and
      data.

      Implementation of the Raft consensus protocol. The library doesn't assume a network layer with ordering or duplicate detection. This
      means you could use UDP for transmission.

    description: Improved scalable and fault-tolerant distributed architecture
    tech_desc: >
      Cloud platform services must simultaneously be scalable, meet low tail latency service-level objectives, and be resilient to a
      combination of software, hardware, and network failures. Replication plays a fundamental role in meeting both the scalability and the
      fault-tolerance requirement, but is subject to opposing requirements: (1) scalability is typicallyachieved by relaxing consistency;
      (2) fault-tolerance is typically achieved through the consistent replication of state machines. Adding nodes to a system can therefore
      either increase performance at the expense of consistency, or increase resiliency at the expense of performance. We propose
      HovercRaft, a new approach by which adding nodes increases both the resilience and the performance of general-purpose state-machine
      replication.
