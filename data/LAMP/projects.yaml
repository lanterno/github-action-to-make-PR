      Scala.js optimizes your Scala code into highly efficient JavaScript.
      Strong typing guarantees your code is free of silly mistakes. You can use
      any JavaScript library right from your Scala.js code, either in a
      statically or dynamically typed way.

    layman_desc: >
      Scala 3 is a major update to the Scala programming language.   It aims to
      make the language more solid, learnable, and expressive. Changes include
      new type system features, simplifications to make code safer, restrictions
      on surprising behaviors, and an overhaul of metaprogramming capabilities.
    tech_desc: >
      Scala 3 implements many language changes and improvements over Scala 2. It
      strengthens Scala's foundations, makes the language easier and safer to
      use, and improves the consistency and expressiveness of language
      constructs. Key changes include intersection and union types, trait
      parameters, given instances, opaque type aliases, restricted implicit
      conversions, and a new metaprogramming model.
