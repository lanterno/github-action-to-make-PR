    description: Highly detailed heap profiler
    tech_desc: >
      Modern software systems heavily use the memory heap. As systems grow more
      complex and compute with increasing amounts of data, it can be difficult
      for developers to understand how their programs actually use the bytes
      that they allocate on the heap and whether improvements are possible.
      Memoro as built to answer this question of heap usage efficiency. It uses
      a combination of static instrumentation, subroutine interception, and
      runtime data collection to build a clear picture of exactly when and where
      a program performs heap allocation, and crucially how it actually uses
      that memory. Memoro also introduces a new visualization application that
      can distill collected data into scores and visual cues that allow
      developers to quickly pinpoint and eliminate inefficient heap usage in
      their software.

    description: Precise side-channel analysis
    tech_desc: >
      Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information from
      non-functional characteristics. Typical side-channel detection tools are
      able to identify many potential vulnerabilities, but do not provide
      information regarding their severity, making it difficult for developers
      to decide whether to address them, as their leaks are often negligible in
      practice. Abacus is able to precisely quantify the leaked information and
      finds flaws that would otherwise be difficult for a developer to find.

    description: Bitfiltrator is an automated bitstream parameter extraction tool
      for Xilinx UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs.
    tech_desc: >
      Prior work has reverse-engineered parts of the bitstream format for
      security or debugging/instrumentation activities, but no paper has
      explained how to do this reverse engineering systematically! Our work
      bridges this gap by explaining: (1) the various parameters needed to
      navigate a bitstream correctly, (2) the experiments to obtain them, and
      (3) the many pitfalls and erroneous assumptions to avoid while undertaking
      this endeavor. We demonstrate our technique by using it to extract the
      bitstream format of initial LUT equations, LUTRAM contents, BRAM contents,
      and register values in Xilinx UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs. Our
      methods are implemented in an open-source tool, Bitfiltrator [1], that can
      extract device layouts and architecture-specific bitstream formats for
      these cells automatically and without physical access to an FPGA.
