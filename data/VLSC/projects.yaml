    description: Highly detailed heap profiler
    tech_desc: >
      Modern software systems heavily use the memory heap. As systems grow more complex and compute with increasing amounts of data, it can
      be difficult for developers to understand how their programs actually use the bytes that they allocate on the heap and whether
      improvements are possible. Memoro as built to answer this question of heap usage efficiency. It uses a combination of static
      instrumentation, subroutine interception, and runtime data collection to build a clear picture of exactly when and where a program
      performs heap allocation, and crucially how it actually uses that memory. Memoro also introduces a new visualization application that
      can distill collected data into scores and visual cues that allow developers to quickly pinpoint and eliminate inefficient heap usage
      in their software.

    description: Precise side-channel analysis
    tech_desc: >
      Side-channel attacks allow adversaries to infer sensitive information from non-functional characteristics. Typical side-channel
      detection tools are able to identify many potential vulnerabilities, but do not provide information regarding their severity, making
      it difficult for developers to decide whether to address them, as their leaks are often negligible in practice. Abacus is able to
      precisely quantify the leaked information and finds flaws that would otherwise be difficult for a developer to find.

    description: Bitfiltrator is an automated bitstream parameter extraction tool for Xilinx UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs.
    tech_desc: >
      Prior work has reverse-engineered parts of the bitstream format for security or debugging/instrumentation activities, but no paper has
      explained how to do this reverse engineering systematically! Our work bridges this gap by explaining: (1) the various parameters
      needed to navigate a bitstream correctly, (2) the experiments to obtain them, and (3) the many pitfalls and erroneous assumptions to
      avoid while undertaking this endeavor. We demonstrate our technique by using it to extract the bitstream format of initial LUT
      equations, LUTRAM contents, BRAM contents, and register values in Xilinx UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs. Our methods are implemented
      in an open-source tool, Bitfiltrator [1], that can extract device layouts and architecture-specific bitstream formats for these cells
      automatically and without physical access to an FPGA.
