    tech_desc: >
      Video quality assessment with subjective testing is both time consuming and expensive. An interesting new approach to traditional
      testing is the so-called crowdsourcing, moving the testing effort into the internet. QualityCrowd allows to perform subjective quality
      assessment with crowdsourcing. QualityCrowd allows codec independent quality assessment with a simple web interface, usable with
      common web browsers.

      The renderer supports visualization of point clouds with real-time interaction, while viewing conditions can be configured. The user
      is able to choose between either an adaptive, or a fixed splat size rendering mode in order to display the models. The renderer
      supports both PLY and PCD point cloud file formats. The current settings have been optimized for voxelized contents, without this
      limiting its usage, since any point cloud can be displayed independently of its geometric structure.

    description: Learning residual coding for point clouds
    tech_desc: >
      Recent  advancements  in  acquisition  of  three-dimensional  models have been  increasingly  drawing  attention  toimaging modalities
      based on the plenoptic representations, such as light fields and point clouds.  Since point cloudmodels can often contain millions of
      points, each including both geometric positions and associated attributes,efficient compression schemes are needed to enable
      transmission and storage of this type of media. This project presents a detachable learning-based residual module for point cloud
      compression that allows for efficientscalable coding.

    description: Correctly re-identify people in different images
    tech_desc: >
      In person re-identification, people must to be correctly identified in images that come from different cameras or are captured at
      different points in time. In the open-set case, the above needs be achieved for persons that have not been previously observed. We
      propose a universal method for building a multi-shot gallery of observed reference identities recurrently online.

    description: Privacy-preserving camera system tracking individual body temperatures
    tech_desc: >
      Many contagious diseases such as Covid19 can induce high temperatures and fever in a significant number of affected individuals.
      Contact tracing of such individuals and analysis of their behaviour  and interactions with others and their environment can be a
      useful tool to contain spread of contagious diseases. A key component of ProCam is an innovative camera that combines infrared/thermal
      and visible light sensors while securing the visible light images. Privacy-preserving camera systems are important as more and more
      people are concerned about the ethics of massive surveillance and invasion of privacy. ProCam solves this by using a cryptographic
      tool to hide the visible light images, only allowing to retrieve identites with the use of cryptographic keys.

      Currently, TV audiences can only interact with the shows they are watching through social media or hybrid broadcast broadband TV.
      Additionally, content creators in film, TV or live productions face technical challenges that result in less engaging content. The
      EU-funded AdMiRe project aims to tackle both these problems by developing, validating and demonstrating innovative solutions based on
      mixed reality technology. These solutions will enable audiences at home to be incorporated into the live TV programme they are
      watching and to interact with people in the TV studio. They will also provide content creators with tools that radically improve
      talent immersion and interaction with computer-generated elements.
