    tech_desc: >
      Machine Learning classifiers and tools to help with the detection of specific risks and threats children are facing while using their
      newly acquired phones. The classifiers perform on par or better than what exists on the market, and have been adapted to run smoothly
      on a mobile phone. The analysis can therefore run on the mobile phone without having to send any content to any server.

    layman_desc: >
      This tool visualizes how similar or different news articles about the
      same event are from multiple perspectives. It can show if articles
      have a positive or negative stance on the topic. This helps users
      understand if they are caught in a filter bubble and exposes them to
      diverse viewpoints. It also assists journalists in positioning their
      articles among others covering the same story.
    tech_desc: >
      The project aims to visualize semantic similarity and polarity of news
      articles covering a given media event. It extends the NewsTeller
      platform which processes over 1.5 million news articles per month.
      The goal is to provide intuitive visualization tools to explore the
      media landscape and enhance the NewsTeller platform.

      Automated image selection system for news articles

    applications:

    layman_desc: >
      It is an automated system that can recommend suitable images to illustrate 
      news articles by analyzing the text content of the articles. 
      The system can handle inputs in multiple languages like German and French 
      by using aligned multilingual word embeddings. 
      It uses advanced neural network techniques like attention to identify 
      the most relevant parts of the text for retrieving matching images from a 
      large database.
    tech_desc: >
      The system fuses multiple textual sources (caption, body, headline, lead) 
      from news articles using a hierarchical attention mechanism to retrieve 
      relevant images. 
      It utilizes subword embeddings and self-attention to better encode 
      entities and capture important keywords within texts. 
      The model is trained on a large-scale multimodal multilingual dataset of 
      over 500k German and French news article-image pairs in a 
      weakly-supervised manner.
