    description: Platform for detecting specific risks and threats children are
      facing online
    url: https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsir/ai-research-aiding-online-children-safety
    tech_desc: >
      Machine Learning classifiers and tools to help with the detection of
      specific risks and threats children are facing while using their newly
      acquired phones. The classifiers perform on par or better than what exists
      on the market, and have been adapted to run smoothly on a mobile phone.
      The analysis can therefore run on the mobile phone without having to send
      any content to any server.

    layman_desc: >
      This tool visualizes how similar or different news articles about the same
      event are from multiple perspectives. It can show if articles have a
      positive or negative stance on the topic. This helps users understand if
      they are caught in a filter bubble and exposes them to diverse viewpoints.
      It also assists journalists in positioning their articles among others
      covering the same story.
    tech_desc: >
      The project aims to visualize semantic similarity and polarity of news
      articles covering a given media event. It extends the NewsTeller platform
      which processes over 1.5 million news articles per month. The goal is to
      provide intuitive visualization tools to explore the media landscape and
      enhance the NewsTeller platform.

      Automated image selection system for news articles

    layman_desc: >
      It is an automated system that can recommend suitable images to
      illustrate  news articles by analyzing the text content of the
      articles.  The system can handle inputs in multiple languages like German
      and French  by using aligned multilingual word embeddings.  It uses
      advanced neural network techniques like attention to identify  the most
      relevant parts of the text for retrieving matching images from a  large
      database.
    tech_desc: >
      The system fuses multiple textual sources (caption, body, headline,
      lead)  from news articles using a hierarchical attention mechanism to
      retrieve  relevant images.  It utilizes subword embeddings and
      self-attention to better encode  entities and capture important keywords
      within texts.  The model is trained on a large-scale multimodal
      multilingual dataset of  over 500k German and French news article-image
      pairs in a  weakly-supervised manner.
