    description: Memory allocation preventing "use-after-free" exploits
    tech_desc: >
      ffmalloc is a "one time allocator" where any given virtual memory address is only returned to the calling application once. Since
      exploitation of use-after-free errors relies on being able to modify memory associated with "dangling pointers," by not reusing a
      virtual address region in subsequent allocation, an adversary cannot negatively impact the dangling memory region.

    description: Efficient Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) access
    tech_desc: >
      Non-Volatile Memory (NVM), which provides relatively fast and byte-addressable persistence, is now commercially available. However, we
      cannot equate a real NVM with a slow DRAM, as it is much more complicated than we expect. We propose guidelines for designing
      high-performance persistent index structures, allowing to increase performance and tail latency.

      SynCord is a framework to modify kernel locks without recompiling or rebooting the kernel. It abstracts key behaviors of kernel locks
      and exposes them as APIs for designing user-defined kernel locks. SynCord provides the mechanisms to customize kernel locks safely and

      Odinfs is a NUMA-aware PM file system based on an opportunistic delegation framework to achieve datapath scalability. It limits
      concurrent PM access to avoid performance meltdown due to on-DIMM cache trashing. It localizes PM access to avoid performance meltdown
      due to remote PM access. It automatically parallelizes large PM access to utilize cumulative PM bandwidth across all NUMA nodes. It
      maximizes concurrent access within the same file with scalable synchronization primitives.

    layman_desc: >
      In multi-core systems, locks are used to coordinate access to shared
      data, but traditional lock designs can hurt performance by moving data
      between cores.  TCLocks is a new way to implement locks that avoids
      this data movement.  When a core needs to execute a critical section of
      code guarded by a lock, it sends that code segment to the core holding
      the lock.  That core then runs the code locally without transferring
      data.  This transparent delegation approach improves performance
      significantly without changing application code.
    tech_desc: >
      TCLocks is a family of locking protocols that use transparent delegation
      to improve scalability of synchronization in multi-core systems.  The
      waiter encodes its critical section on its stack and notifies the lock
      holder (combiner), which executes the critical section on the waiter's
      behalf via a light-weight context switch.  This avoids transferring
      shared data between cores.  TCLocks require no modifications to
      application logic and provide up to 5.2x better performance than recent
      locking algorithms.

    layman_desc: >
      Trio is a new way to build file systems that run entirely in user space
      and take full advantage of fast non-volatile memory (NVM). It separates
      the core metadata that defines the file system structure from auxiliary
      metadata that applications can customize for their needs. This split
      design allows applications to access NVM directly for performance,
      while still having integrity of the core metadata verified by a trusted
      system component. Trio includes ArckFS, a general POSIX-like file
      system, as well as examples of customized application-specific file
      systems that are faster than previous NVM file systems.
    tech_desc: >
      Trio is a userspace NVM file system architecture that decouples file
      system design, access control, and metadata integrity enforcement. It
      defines a core state data structure shared between LibFSes and a
      trusted entity. LibFSes can customize with private auxiliary state while
      directly accessing NVM. The trusted entity verifies core state integrity
      when write access transfers between LibFSes. This allows customization
      while ensuring metadata integrity. Trio includes ArckFS, a POSIX-like
      FS, and customized FSes that outperform existing NVM file systems.
