      System support for byzantine machine learning
    type: Library
    tech_desc: >
      Garfield is a library to build Byzantine machine learning (ML) applications on top of popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and
      PyTorch. We show how to use Garfield to build different architectures for ML applications like single server, multiple workers (SSMW),
      multiple servers, multiple workers (MSMW), and fully decentralized architecture.
    layman_desc: >
      Training ML is done in a distributed fashion these days due to the usage of big models and huge datasets (for scalability reasons).
      This distribution inevitably leads to a higher probability of failure somewhere in the network. Garfield is a library/tool to ensure
      the correctness/convergence of training despite the presence of these failures. Garfield can be used to do so with various ML
      applications and architectures.

    description: Asset Transfer System using lightweight broadcast-based primitives instead of consensus

      AT2 is a full-fledged asset transfer system (cryptocurrency) without the need for a global consensus, allowing for faster transactions
      and better scalability than Bitcoin and consensus-based solutions.
    tech_desc: >
      We replace consensus with a lightweight building block -- a broadcast-based primitive -- to obtain a full-fledged asset transfer
      system (cryptocurrency). This system is more efficient and more scalable compared with Bitcoin and consensus-based solutions. AT2 is
      the first system to bypass consensus algorithms for implementing asset transfers.

      LOCKIN is a lock library that includes several lock algorithm implementations mainly in header files for ease of use. Essentially, you
      can use LOCKIN to easily modify the pthread mutex locks in a system with practically zero effort. GLS is a middleware that makes
      lock-based programming simple and effective. GLS offers the classic lock-unlock interface of locks. However, in contrast to classic
      lock libraries, GLS does not require any effort from the programmer for allocating and initializing locks, nor for selecting the
      appropriate locking strategy.

    description: Blockchain using lightweight broadcast-based primitives instead of consensus
    layman_desc: >
      Carbon is a blockchain not using global consensus for transactions, allowing for faster transactions and better scalability than many
      other chains.
    tech_desc: >
      Carbon is the next iteration on AT2, adding many new features, such as minting and a dynamic network. By decoupling leader selection
      from transaction processing, this system is more efficient and more scalable compared with Bitcoin and consensus-based solutions.

    description: Very fast and scalable, resizable hash table
    layman_desc: >
      CLHT contains both a lock-based and lock-free implementation of hash tables. Its optimistic design allows for 50 MegaOP/s in a
      concurrent run.
