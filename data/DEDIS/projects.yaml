    description: Proof that you are an actual person while keeping your anonymity
    layman_desc: >
      The internet allows for anonymous participation. While this is great for
      protecting people like whistleblowers, it can be a burden if people abuse
      it and create many fake accounts. This project implements a way to prove
      that you are a unique individual, while still guaranteeing you anonymity
      while you use services on the internet. Applications range from chat to
      e-voting and energy-efficient blockchains.
    tech_desc: >
      Fake accounts are a big problem on the internet, while not all people want
      or can identify themselves using state-issued identities.
      Proof-of-personhood proposes to use personhood parties where people have
      to physically show up and get identified as real persons. Using
      cryptographic primitives, it is then possible to prove that you were part
      of that group, without revealing your individual identity.

    tech_desc: >
      An attempt to simplify asynchronous consensus by building atop a novel
      threshold logical clock abstraction, which enables upper layers to operate
      as if on a synchronous network. This approach yields an asynchronous
      consensus protocol for fail-stop nodes that may be simpler and more robust
      than Paxos and its leader-based variants, requiring no common coins and
      achieving consensus in a constant expected number of rounds.

    layman_desc: >
      The d-voting project allows for electronic voting without a central point
      of trust. It relies instead on the majority of servers to be honest during
      the voting process. The ballots are encrypted during the voting phase, and
      then shuffled to anonymise the results. When they are finally decrypted,
      it is not possible anymore to retrace who voted for what.
