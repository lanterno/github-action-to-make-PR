    description: Proof that you are an actual person while keeping your anonymity
    layman_desc: >
      The internet allows for anonymous participation. While this is great for protecting people like whistleblowers, it can be a burden if
      people abuse it and create many fake accounts. This project implements a way to prove that you are a unique individual, while still
      guaranteeing you anonymity while you use services on the internet. Applications range from chat to e-voting and energy-efficient
      blockchains.
    tech_desc: >
      Fake accounts are a big problem on the internet, while not all people want or can identify themselves using state-issued identities.
      Proof-of-personhood proposes to use personhood parties where people have to physically show up and get identified as real persons.
      Using cryptographic primitives, it is then possible to prove that you were part of that group, without revealing your individual
      identity.

      An attempt to simplify asynchronous consensus by building atop a novel threshold logical clock abstraction, which enables upper layers
      to operate as if on a synchronous network. This approach yields an asynchronous consensus protocol for fail-stop nodes that may be
      simpler and more robust than Paxos and its leader-based variants, requiring no common coins and achieving consensus in a constant
      expected number of rounds.

      The d-voting project allows for electronic voting without a central point of trust.
      It relies instead on the majority of servers to be honest during the voting process.
      The ballots are encrypted during the voting phase, and then shuffled to anonymise the results.
      When they are finally decrypted, it is not possible anymore to retrace who voted for what.
