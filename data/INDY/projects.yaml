    description: Machine Learning framework to search a database via similarity samples
    url: https://who-is-th.at/
    tech_desc: >
      Use machine learning to organize a collection of objects (e.g. faces of
      actors) so as to make them interactively searchable via similarity
      queries. The approach combines concepts from representation learning,
      reinforcement learning, discrete-choice theory and bayesian inference.

    description: Dynamic skill rating system
    tech_desc: >
      Kickscore can be used to understand & visualize the skill of players (or
      teams) competing in pairwise matches, and to predict outcomes of future
      matches. It extends the Elo rating system and TrueSkill.

    description: Predictions about votes in Switzerland
    url: http://www.predikon.ch/
    layman_desc: >
      Predikon provides predictions about votes in Switzerland, as soon as
      municipal results are published by Swiss cantons starting at 12:00 pm on
      the day of a vote.
    tech_desc: >
      We designed a predictive model of the municipal results (in percentage of
      "yes") for Swiss votes. Based on past results, our model automatically
      learns features of municipalities. On the day of a vote, and as soon as
      some municipalities publish their results (their percentage of "yes"), our
      model uses the features to predict the unpublished results of other
      municipalities. The prediction of the national vote result is obtained by
      aggregating published results and predicted results.

    url: https://climpact.ch/
    layman_desc: >
      For the climate, flying to New York is worse than taking a long shower.
      But is it 10 times worse or is it 1000 times worse? The carbon footprint
      of our actions have been widely analyzed and quantified, but it does not
      mean that people are well aware of their impact. With this project, we
      would like to understand people’s perception of their carbon footprint,
      and how does it compare to the actual carbon footprint of actions they
      take. This could help climate scientists, sociologists, news outlets,
      politicians, and the general public to improve climate communication and
      enhance climate action.
