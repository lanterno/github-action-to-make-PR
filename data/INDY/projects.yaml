    url: https://who-is-th.at/
    tech_desc: >
      Use machine learning to organize a collection of objects (e.g. faces of actors) so as to make them interactively searchable via
      similarity queries. The approach combines concepts from representation learning, reinforcement learning, discrete-choice theory and
      bayesian inference.

    description: Dynamic skill rating system
    tech_desc: >
      Kickscore can be used to understand & visualize the skill of players (or teams) competing in pairwise matches, and to predict outcomes
      of future matches. It extends the Elo rating system and TrueSkill.

    description: Predictions about votes in Switzerland
    url: http://www.predikon.ch/
    layman_desc: >
      Predikon provides predictions about votes in Switzerland, as soon as municipal results are published by Swiss cantons starting at
      12:00 pm on the day of a vote.
    tech_desc: >
      We designed a predictive model of the municipal results (in percentage of "yes") for Swiss votes. Based on past results, our model
      automatically learns features of municipalities. On the day of a vote, and as soon as some municipalities publish their results (their
      percentage of "yes"), our model uses the features to predict the unpublished results of other municipalities. The prediction of the
      national vote result is obtained by aggregating published results and predicted results.

    description: Estimate your perception of carbon footprint
    url: https://climpact.ch/
    layman_desc: >
      For the climate, flying to New York is worse than taking a long shower. But is it 10 times worse or is it 1000 times worse? The carbon
      footprint of our actions have been widely analyzed and quantified, but it does not mean that people are well aware of their impact.
      With this project, we would like to understand people’s perception of their carbon footprint, and how does it compare to the actual
      carbon footprint of actions they take. This could help climate scientists, sociologists, news outlets, politicians, and the general
      public to improve climate communication and enhance climate action.
