      Software stack and toolchain for building and running software middleboxes that are guaranteed to be correct, while providing
      competitive performance and preserving developer productivity. With Vigor, developers write the middlebox code (i.e., the software
      network function, or NF) in C atop a standard packet-processing framework, putting persistent state in data structures from a
      Vigor-provided library. Vigor then automatically verifies that the resulting software stack correctly implements a specification

    description: Performance contracts for software network functions
    layman_desc: >
      Software network functions (NFs), or middleboxes, promise flexibility and easy deployment of network services but face the serious
      challenge of unexpected performance behaviour. This behaviour makes it harder for network operators to provision their networks and
      exposes a new attack surface for adversaries seeking to degrade network performance. The goal of our work is to provide network
      operators and NF developers with comprehensive understanding of the NF’s entire performance profile, before it is deployed. Such
      understanding would, for instance, allow operators to conduct precise capacity planning and developers to make informed development
      decisions.
    tech_desc: >
      We propose the notion of performance contracts for NFs. A performance contract enables users to predict and scrutinize NF performance
      at fine granularities without having to run them. It provider users with an abstraction that enables them to easily parameterize
      arbitrary input workloads, whether typical, exceptional or adversarial. Given only this abstract description of the workload and not a
      concrete instance, the contract predicts the performance of the NF without actually running it. The performance predictions are in
      terms of human-readable formulae, expressed as a function of workload and environment variables, that we together call Performance
      Critical Variables (PCVs). informed development decisions.

    description: Fast and precise control-flow hijack protection
    tech_desc: >
      Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) is a property of C/C++ programs that guarantees absence of control-flow hijack attacks by requiring
      integrity of all direct and indirect pointers to code. Code-Pointer Separation (CPS) is a simplified version of CPI that provides
      strong protection against such attacks in practice. SafeStack is a component of CPI/CPS, which can be used independently and protects
      against stack-based control-flow hijacks.

      eBPF-SE is a tool that symbolically executes eBPF programs written
      for the Linux kernel. It is based on the KLEE symbolic execution
      engine and uses models (stubs) for the Linux kernel's libbpf API.
      This allows exploring all program paths without path explosion from
      the real API implementation. eBPF-SE was previously part of PIX, a
      tool that extracts performance interfaces from network function code.
