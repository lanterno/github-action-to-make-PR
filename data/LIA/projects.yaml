    description: Data distribution-aware differential privacy
    tech_desc: >
      Traditional differential privacy is independent of the data distribution. However, this is not well-matched with the modern machine
      learning con-text, where models are trained on specific data. As a result, achieving meaningful privacy guarantees in ML often
      excessively reduces accuracy. Bayesian differential privacy (BDP) takes into account the data distribution to provide more practical
      privacy guarantees.

    description: Continual adaption of recommendation systems without forgetting
    tech_desc: >
      Recommendation systems typically require continual adaptation to take into account new and obsolete items. A major challenge in this
      situation is catastrophic forgetting, where the trained model forgets patterns it has learned before. We propose a method to mitigate
      this effect.
