    description: Data distribution-aware differential privacy
    tech_desc: >
      Traditional differential privacy is independent of the data distribution.
      However, this is not well-matched with the modern machine learning
      con-text, where models are trained on specific data. As a result,
      achieving meaningful privacy guarantees in ML often excessively reduces
      accuracy. Bayesian differential privacy (BDP) takes into account the data
      distribution to provide more practical privacy guarantees.

    description: Continual adaption of recommendation systems without forgetting
    tech_desc: >
      Recommendation systems typically require continual adaptation to take into
      account new and obsolete items. A major challenge in this situation is
      catastrophic forgetting, where the trained model forgets patterns it has
      learned before. We propose a method to mitigate this effect.
