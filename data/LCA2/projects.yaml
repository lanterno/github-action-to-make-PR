    description: Testbed for multi-agent real-time control of electric grids
    tech_desc: >
      T-RECS is a software testbed for multi-agent real-time control of electric grids. T-RECS uses software containers to run each agent in
      a virtual environment. Agents are networked via Mininet, so real packets are exchanged using TCP/IP.
