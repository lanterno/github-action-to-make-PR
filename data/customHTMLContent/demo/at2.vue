  <h3>This project has been retired from the C4DT Factory Incubator</h3>
  <p>
    We do not host this demo anymore, and unfortunately we cannot provide the source code of the project. If you're
    interested, please contact us, and we'll get you in contact with the original authors.

  <p>Here are some screenshots of the demo:</p>

        <img

          alt="Welcome screen of the AT2 demo showing some text and an
                  image representing data on a half-circle"
        />
        <br />The introduction of the demo with a short explanation of what it is about.

          alt="A short explanation of how to create an account, a field for
                  choosing a name, and a button to update the username."
        />
        <br />On the next screen it shows the account creation and the network of the nodes.

          alt="A simple form to send some of your assets over to network
                  to another account."
        />
        <br />Now you can transfer some assets to one of the other accounts on the network. For this test you have 100k
        coins of whatever value (currently 0US$ :)

          alt="A form to choose a destination and how much transactions should be performed.
                Below is a test-run which shows that AT2 managed to do around 900 transactions
                per second."
        />
        <br />To show the performance of AT2, you can perform a speedtest where it tries to send the tokens as fast as
        possible over the network. Once the tokens are sent, it waits for confirmation from the network, which can take
        longer than the actual sending.

  <h4>Former description</h4>
  <p>
    The
    <a href="https://factory.c4dt.org/incubator/at2/demo/">AT2 Demonstrator</a>
    will show you the power lying behind this technology. In a tutorial approach, you'll be taken through the creation
    of your account on the deployed test network. Then, you'll be able to send some assets to other accounts already
    registered there, as you would do on other distributed ledgers. To show that indeed AT2 is blazingly fast, the last
    part is a speed test where you can send as many transactions as you want and measure how well the network handles
    the load.
