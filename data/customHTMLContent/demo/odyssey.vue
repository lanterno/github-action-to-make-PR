  <h3>This project has been retired from the C4DT Factory Incubator</h3>
  <p>It is no longer actively supported. However, if you have questions or suggestions, feel free to contact us.</p>
  <p>
    Together with our C4DT partner Swiss Re and the DEDIS lab, we created a pilot to solve one of Swiss Re's business
    use cases. Their data analysts need to be able to calculate with data from different sources that have different
    restrictions. These restrictions can include only being able to work in a certain jurisdiction, or not being allowed
    to be used together with other data, or only to be handled by a restricted set of data analysts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the access control system of Calypso, all these requirements have been mapped. It now allows a data owner to
    enter their dataset into the system, together with the access rules that need to apply. The data scientists can then
    request the datasets and use them in a secure environment.
