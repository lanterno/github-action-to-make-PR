    Besides the documentation and source code of MedCo-Explore, we also provide a way to try out this software. To do
    that just log in our <a href="https://medco.epfl.ch/demo/">live demo</a> using the correct credentials. We are
    running MedCo-Explore with 3 different data providers (clinical sites) with 8,000 patients. For test purposes the
    data is synthetically generated.
