    Lightarti was developed during the work on SwissCovid at C4DT, in collaboration with Carmela Troncoso's lab. It
    allows mobile applications to use the Tor network for low-bandwidth calls like sending telemetry data in an
    anonymous way. Contrary to other tor-libraries, lightarti-rest reduces bandwidth usage to a minimum, while keeping
    security and privacy to a maximum.
