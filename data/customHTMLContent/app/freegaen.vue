    We produced a version of SwissCovid that uses this approach to run on any phone that does not have access to Google
    Play services. The resulting application, LibreCHovid, is
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.corona.tracing/">available on the F-Droid store</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The F-Droid store does not provide statistics regarding how many users installed an app, for privacy reasons.
    However, comments, issue reports and feature requests by the community indicate that there is a demand and a user
    base for this version of SwissCovid.
