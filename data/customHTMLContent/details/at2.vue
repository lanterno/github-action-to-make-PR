    Blockchains have been around for some years now, you've probably come across the term multiple times. But what is a
    blockchain? Put simply, it's a way to send some virtual money without using banks or intermediaries. There is no
    central authority keeping tabs on who owns what, rather, each participant validates every monetary transaction. One
    of the most known and used is Bitcoin, which uses what is called a proof-of-work to achieve that, a very energy
    intensive process. It can handle around 7 transactions per second (TPS), which is not great compared to payment
    systems like Visa which handles 40'000 TPS.
