    DP3T is a secure, decentralized, privacy-preserving proximity tracing system. Its goal is to simplify and accelerate
    the process of identifying people who have been in contact with an infected person, thus providing a technological
    foundation to help slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The system aims to minimise privacy and security risks
    for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection.
