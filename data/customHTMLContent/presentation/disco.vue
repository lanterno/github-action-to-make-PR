    Disco greatly simplify access to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing">distributed</a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>, It runs in a browser, allowing it to
    work on pretty much any platform, simply open the link in a browser and you're using it.
    <br />
    It allows creating your own machine learning tasks so that others can help with theses by just loading their data in
    the browser. By computing theses tasks, you create a machine learning model, a mathematical system which allows a
    program to make predictions based on a given set of data. It fits many use cases, such as determining the likeliness
    that some hospital patient has a disease, or automatically determine what an image represents.

    Disco is in full development, adding new features and algorithms regularly. It aims at being the breeding ground for
    new machine learning technologies. Here goes a list of papers to be integrated into it
