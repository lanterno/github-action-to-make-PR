    CrowdNotifier has been developed by the prof. Carmela Troncoso. It is a protocol that can complement manual contact
    tracing by efficiently notifying visitors of venues and events with SARS-CoV-2-positive attendees. It provides
    strong privacy and abuse- resistance, and show that it can scale to handle notification at a national scale.

  <p>The C4DT team was involved in the research and development process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/CrowdNotifier/libcrowdnotifier">Reference implementation</a> to make sure the
      specification is complete
    </li>
    <li>Pilot at EPFL - involving installing the QRcodes in 30+ rooms at EPFL</li>
    <li>Administrative interface - to handle all QRcodes and send out notifications</li>
  </ul>

  <p>CrowdNotifier has been implemented by the Ubique team and is now part of the SwissCovid App.</p>
