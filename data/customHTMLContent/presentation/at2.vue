    In this specific case of asset transfer, one doesn't need a "full-blockchain", only some simpler primitives. Here
    comes AT2, which allows for the same capabilities as Bitcoin while being orders of magnitudes faster, around 10'000
    TPS. By avoiding the classical proof-of-work used in other blockchains, it also greatly reduces the total energy
    consumption.

    In the demonstrator, you will be able to create your own account on the AT2 chain, that we graciously fill up with
    an initial number of assets. You can then send assets to some other previously registered user. You will also be
    performing a speedtest to measure how many transactions the system can hold. The main AT2 network is currently run
    at EPFL by some labs and interested users.
