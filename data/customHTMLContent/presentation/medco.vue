<p>MedCo is the first operational system that makes sensitive medical-data
available for research in a simple, privacy-conscious and secure way. It enables
a consortium of clinical sites to collectively protect their data and to
securely share them with investigators, without single points of failure.
</p>
<p>MedCo applies advanced privacy and security techniques, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Collective homomorphic encryption</li>
    <li>Secure multi-party computation</li>
    <li>Distributed Ledger Technologies</li>
</ul>
