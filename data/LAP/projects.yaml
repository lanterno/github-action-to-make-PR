    description: High-level synthesis compiler
    tech_desc: >
      Dynamatic is an academic, open-source high-level synthesis compiler that
      produces synchronous dynamically-scheduled circuits from C/C++ code. It
      delivers significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art
      commercial tools in specific situations.

    description: Group DRAM bursts
    tech_desc: >
      DynaBurst is a highly flexible, FPGA-optimized, memory system for
      bandwidth-bound accelerators that perform frequent irregular accesses to
      DRAM memory. DynaBurst is an extension of the lab's miss-optimized
      nonblocking cache which groups incoming requests into bursts of memory
      requests.
