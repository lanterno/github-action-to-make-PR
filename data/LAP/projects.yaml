    description: High-level synthesis compiler
    tech_desc: >
      Dynamatic is an academic, open-source high-level synthesis compiler that produces synchronous dynamically-scheduled circuits from
      C/C++ code. It delivers significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art commercial tools in specific situations.

    description: Group DRAM bursts
    tech_desc: >
      DynaBurst is a highly flexible, FPGA-optimized, memory system for bandwidth-bound accelerators that perform frequent irregular
      accesses to DRAM memory. DynaBurst is an extension of the lab's miss-optimized nonblocking cache which groups incoming requests into
      bursts of memory requests.
