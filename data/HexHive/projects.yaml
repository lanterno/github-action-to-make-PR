      Our evaluation shows that on the Google fuzzer test suite, FuZZan improves fuzzing throughput over ASan by 48% starting with Google’s
      provided seeds (52% when starting with empty seeds on the same applications). Due to this improved throughput, FuZZan discovers 13%
      more unique paths given the same 24 hours and finds bugs 42% faster

    tech_desc: >
      Magma is a collection of open-source libraries with widespread usage and a long history of security-critical bugs and vulnerabilities.
      In light of the need for better fuzzer evaluation, we front-ported bugs from previous bug reports to the latest versions of these
      libraries.

      For each ported bug, we added in-line (source-code-level) instrumentation to collect ground-truth information about bugs reached
      (buggy code executed) and triggered (fault condition satisfied by input). This instrumentation allows a monitoring utility to measure
      fuzzer progress in real time.

    description: LLVM Implementation of different ShadowStack schemes for x86_64
    layman_desc: >
      In computer security, a shadow stack is a mechanism for protecting a procedure's stored return address, such as from a stack buffer
      overflow. The shadow stack itself is a second, separate stack that \"shadows\" the program call stack. In the function prologue, a
      function stores its return address to both the call stack and the shadow stack. In the function epilogue, a function loads the return
      address from both the call stack and the shadow stack, and then compares them. If the two records of the return address differ, then
      an attack is detected; the typical course of action is simply to terminate the program or alert system administrators about a possible
      intrusion attempt.

      Attacks change the execution behavior of a system. Our attack detection system HexPADS detects attacks through divergences from normal
      behavior using attack signatures. HexPADS collects information from the operating system on runtime performance metrics with
      measurements from hardware performance counters for individual processes. Cache behavior is a strong indicator of ongoing attacks like
      rowhammer, side channels, covert channels, or CAIN attacks. Collecting performance metrics across all running processes allows the
      correlation and detection of these attacks. In addition, HexPADS can mitigate the attacks or significantly reduce their effectiveness
      with negligible overhead to benign processes.

      Fuzzing has emerged as the most effective bug-finding technique. The output of a fuzzer is a set of proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases
      for all observed “unique” crashes. It costs developers substantial efforts to analyze each crashing test case. This, mostly manual,
      process has lead to the number of reported crashes out-pacing the number of bug fixes. Igor is a tool for automated crash

      DatAFLow is a fuzzer built on top of AFL++. However, instead of a control-flow-based feedback mechanism, it uses a data-flow-based
      feedback mechanism; specifically, data flows based on def-use associations.

    description: Systematic kernel TOCTTOU protection
    tech_desc: >
      During a syscall, the kernel might read multiple times a value from userspace. As theses are controlled by the unpriviliged process,
      it may introduce subtle changes of behavior and possible hard-to-detect attacks, a classic time-of-check-to-time-of-use bug. Midas
      disable this attack surface by always returning the same values during a given syscall.

    description: Fuzzing WebGL Through Error Message Guided Mutation
    tech_desc: >
      Our fuzzing technique, GLeeFuzz, guides input mutation by error messages instead of code coverage. Our key observation is that
      browsers emit meaningful error messages to aid developers in debugging their WebGL programs. Error messages indicate which part of the
      input fails (e.g., incomplete arguments, invalid arguments, or unsatisfied dependencies between API calls). Leveraging error messages
      as feedback, the fuzzer effectively expands coverage by focusing mutation on erroneous parts of the input. We analyze Chrome’s WebGL
      implementation to identify the dependencies between error-emitting statements and rejected parts of the input, and use this
      information to guide input mutation. We evaluate our GLeeFuzz prototype on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on diverse desktop and mobile
      OSes. We discovered 7 vulnerabilities, 4 in Chrome, 2 in Safari, and 1 in Firefox. The Chrome vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker
      to freeze the GPU and possibly execute remote code at the browser privilege.

    tech_desc: >
      Evocatio automatically discovers a bug’s capabilities: analyzing a crashing test case (i.e., an input exposing a bug) to understand
      the full extent of how an attacker can exploit a bug. Evocatio leverages a capability-guided fuzzer to efficiently uncover new bug
      capabilities (rather than only generating a single crashing test case for a given bug, as a traditional greybox fuzzer does).

      We implement tripwiring-directed fuzzing as a prototype, Sieve-Fuzz, and evaluate it alongside the state-of-the-art directed fuzzers
      AFLGo, BEACON and the leading undirected fuzzer AFL++. Overall, across nine benchmarks, SieveFuzz’s tripwiring enables it to trigger
      bugs on an average 47% more consistently and 117% faster than AFLGo, BEACON and AFL++.
