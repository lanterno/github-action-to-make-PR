      This project aims to provide evidence of traffic differentiation practices
      by Internet providers. It first detects if a provider differentiates
      against certain types of traffic. If differentiation is detected,
      additional tests are run to determine if it is occurring within the user's
      Internet provider. This can empower users to make informed choices about
      their Internet access and assist policymakers in understanding the
      landscape. The system does not require access to provider infrastructure,
      instead relying on end-to-end performance measurements from user devices.

      This project detects traffic differentiation using end-to-end throughput
      comparisons between an original network trace and a bit-inverted version
      that hides any packet payload patterns. It then attempts to localize where
      the differentiation occurs by analyzing measurements from additional paths
      that converge at the client's ISP. The localization relies on throughput
      comparison and loss trend correlation between these paths.

      The project collects screenshots from video game live streams on Twitch.
      It reads the Internet latency numbers displayed on screen during gameplay.
      It figures out the streamer's location from their social media
      information. It processes all this data to estimate the Internet speed in
      different parts of the world.

      The system downloads gaming footage from the Twitch streaming platform. It
      extracts the displayed latency measurements using optical character
      recognition and knowledge of each game's user interface. It maps streamers
      to locations using natural language processing on their social media
      profiles. It analyzes the measurements to produce latency distributions
      per geographical location.
