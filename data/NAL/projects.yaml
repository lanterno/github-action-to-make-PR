      This project aims to provide evidence of traffic differentiation
      practices by Internet providers. It first detects if a provider
      differentiates against certain types of traffic. If differentiation
      is detected, additional tests are run to determine if it is
      occurring within the user's Internet provider. This can empower
      users to make informed choices about their Internet access and
      assist policymakers in understanding the landscape. The system does
      not require access to provider infrastructure, instead relying
      on end-to-end performance measurements from user devices.

      This project detects traffic differentiation using end-to-end
      throughput comparisons between an original network trace and
      a bit-inverted version that hides any packet payload patterns. It
      then attempts to localize where the differentiation occurs by
      analyzing measurements from additional paths that converge at
      the client's ISP. The localization relies on throughput comparison
      and loss trend correlation between these paths.

      Studying Internet latency from Gaming Footage

      The project collects screenshots from video game
      live streams on Twitch. It reads the Internet latency
      numbers displayed on screen during gameplay. It figures out
      the streamer's location from their social media information.
      It processes all this data to estimate the Internet speed
      in different parts of the world.

      The system downloads gaming footage from the Twitch
      streaming platform. It extracts the displayed latency
      measurements using optical character recognition and
      knowledge of each game's user interface. It maps streamers
      to locations using natural language processing on their
      social media profiles. It analyzes the measurements to produce
      latency distributions per geographical location.
